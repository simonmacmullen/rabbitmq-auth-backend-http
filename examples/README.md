# RabbitMQ HTTP Authn/Authz Backend Examples

## Overview

This directory provides a number of community contributed example applications that target
different platforms and frameworks:

 * Python and Django
 * Java and Spring Boot
 * Kotlin and Spring Boot
 * C# and ASP.NET Web API
 * C# and ASP.NET Core 2.1
 * PHP

## Python Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_django` is a very minimalistic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 1.10+ application
that rabbitmq-auth-backend-http can authenticate against. It's really
not designed to be anything other than an example.

### Running the Example

Run

``` shell
start.sh
```

to launch it after [installing Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/install/). You may need to hack `start.sh` if you are not running Debian or Ubuntu.

The app will use a local SQLite database. It uses the standard
Django authentication database. All users get access to all vhosts and
resources.

### HTTP Endpoint Examples

`urls.py` and `auth/views.py` are the main modules that describe HTTP routes and
views (endpoints).


## Spring Boot Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_spring_boot` is a simple [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
application that rabbitmq-auth-backend-http can authenticate against. It's really
not designed to be anything other than an example.

### Running the Example

Import the example as a Maven project in your favorite IDE or run it directly from the command line:

``` shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application listens on the 8080 port.

### HTTP Endpoint Examples

Have a look at the `AuthBackendHttpController`. There's only one user: `guest`,
with the `guest` password. This implementation also checks the
routing key starts with an `a` when publishing to a topic exchange
or consuming from a topic. (an example of [topic authorisation](https://next.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html#topic-authorisation)).

### rabbitmq.config Example

Below is a [RabbitMQ config file](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html) example to go with this
example:

``` ini
auth_backends.1 = http

auth_http.http_method   = post
auth_http.user_path     = http://localhost:8080/auth/user
auth_http.vhost_path    = http://localhost:8080/auth/vhost
auth_http.resource_path = http://localhost:8080/auth/resource
```

## Spring Boot Kotlin Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_spring_boot_kotlin` is a simple [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
application written in Kotlin that rabbitmq-auth-backend-http can authenticate against. It's really
not designed to be anything other than an example.
It contains examples with recommended POST methods and example RabbitMQ configuration.
It can be run the same way as the above example.


## ASP.NET Web API Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_webapi_dotnet` is a very minimalistic ASP.NET Web API application
the plugin can authenticate against. It's really
**not designed to be anything other than an example**.

### Running the Example

Open the WebApiHttpAuthService.csproj in Visual Studio 2017, More details about prerequisites can be found below.

As with other examples, RabbitMQ [authentication and authorization backends](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) must be configured
to use this plugin and the endpoints provided by this example app.

Then Build the solution and run it from Visual Studio.
`Controllers/AuthController.cs` contains the authentication and authorization logic.
By default All users get access to all vhosts and resources.
User "authuser" will be denied access.

### HTTP Endpoint Examples

Have a look at `AuthController`.

### Development Environment

This example was developed using

 * .NET Framework 4.5
 * Visual Studio 2017
 * Windows 10 and IIS v10.0

It is possible to build and run service from Visual Studio browse the endpoint without using IIS.
Port number may vary but will likely be `62190`.

When the example is hosted on IIS, port 80 will be used by default.

## ASP.NET Core 2.1 Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_webapi_dotnetcore` is a modification of the `rabbitmq_auth_backend_webapi_dotnet` example
designed for ASP.NET Core 2.1. It's very similar to the original version but it also adds some static typing
for requests and responses.

### Running the Example

Open the solution file, WebApiHttpAuthService.sln` in Visual Studio 2017 or later.

As with other examples, RabbitMQ [authentication and authorization backends](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) must be configured
to use this plugin and the endpoints provided by this example app.

Then build the solution and run it from Visual Studio.
`Controllers/AuthController.cs` contains the authentication and authorization logic.
By default All users get access to all vhosts and resources.
User "authuser" will be denied access.

### HTTP Endpoint Examples

Have a look at `AuthController`.

### Development Environment

This example was developed using

 * ASP.NET Core 2.1
 * Visual Studio 2017 (Visual Studio Code)
 * Windows 10

It is possible to build and run service from Visual Studio using IIS or from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code using cross-platform server Kestrel.


## PHP Example

`rabbitmq_auth_backend_php` is a minimalistic PHP application that this plugin can authenticate against.
It's really not designed to be anything other than an example.

### Running the Example

The example requires PHP >= 5.4 and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

The `rabbitmq-auth-backend-http-php` library depend on `symfony/security` and `symfony/http-foundation` components.
Go to the `rabbitmq_auth_backend_php` folder and run `composer install`.

``` shell
cd rabbitmq_auth_backend_php/
composer install
```

Now you can run the PHP 5.4 server (server at http://127.0.0.1:8080)

``` shell
composer start
```

Ensure the log file is writable `rabbitmq-auth-backend-http/examples/rabbitmq_auth_backend_php/var/log.log`.

Go to `http://localhost:8080/user.php?username=Anthony&password=anthony-password`, all work properly if you see `Allow administrator`


### HTTP Endpoint Examples

Have a look at the `bootstrap.php`. By default this example implement the same authorization rules than RabbitMQ.

Users list:

| User | password | is admin | Vhost | Configure regex | Write regex | Read regex | tags |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Anthony | anthony-password | ✔️ | All | All | All | All | administrator |
| James | bond | | / | .* | .* | .* | management |
| Roger | rabbit | | | | | | monitoring |
| bunny | bugs | | | | | | policymaker |

### rabbitmq.config Example

Below is a [RabbitMQ config file](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html) example to go with this
example:

``` ini
auth_backends.1 = internal
auth_backends.2 = http

auth_http.user_path     = http://localhost:62190/auth/user.php
auth_http.vhost_path    = http://localhost:62190/auth/vhost.php
auth_http.resource_path = http://localhost:62190/auth/resource.php
auth_http.topic_path    = http://localhost:62190/auth/topic.php
```
